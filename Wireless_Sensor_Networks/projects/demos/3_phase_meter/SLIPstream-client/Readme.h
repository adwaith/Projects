Readme.h

v0:
Works with server v0

v1:
No change in client

v2:
Client will write data to file

v3:
Writes the decimal values to another file, such that the MATLAB code can run on it and process it

v4:
Added calibration constants for V, I and power; and writes to file.

v5:
This is the version that I used forever!
And given to Samsung

v6
1. Time read every 60 packets and written to Raw and Real files
2. Fl data file not used
3. Created new file - NoTime. The data without time stamp written to this gile.

v7
Created for the code that sends out fast and slow slip packets with different identifiers 'M' and 'F'

v8
Created for the modified slip packet with sequence number
The slow data is processed properly. The Mf multiplication happens here.
Raw data written to SlowRaw.txt, Processed float data is written to SlowData.txt

v9
WRiting both fast and slow data to file.
5 types of file written - 
1. Raw slow
2. Processed slow - after all Mf multiplication
3. Raw fast
4. Fast values per packet with time stamp
5. Only the values, 4 in a row, so that it can be plotted in matlab

v10
Refined it?

v11
1. Time stamp written as long (epoch), not in ASCII
2. Only two files are written now, one for fast, one for slow
For fast data, each ms has a time stamp
