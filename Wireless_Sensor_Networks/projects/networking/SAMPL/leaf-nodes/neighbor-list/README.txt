This project shows how a mobile node can periodically ping
for neighbors, collect this data and form an neighbor list
that can be published by a nearby gateway. The neighbor
list contains the full MAC address of each neighbor along
with received RSSI values.  This data is then published
by the gateway to the mobile node's event node in the 
following form:


<Node id="01234567" type="FIREFLY" timestamp="2008-05-10T10:23:00">
   <Link linkNode="00000002" rssi="-42"/>
   <Link linkNode="00000014" rssi="-20"/>
</Node>
